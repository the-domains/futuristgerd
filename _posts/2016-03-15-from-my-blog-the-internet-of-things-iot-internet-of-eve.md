  From my blog: The Internet of Things (IoT) / Internet of Everything
  / Industrial Internet is sizzling hot. Everywhere I go people ask me about it.
  Almost every single event I speak at, some of the biggest tech & IT companies
  in the world are talking about their plans for the IoT, and their billion
  dollar investments.



  Therefore, I figured this is a good time to set a few things straight, and lay
  out what I call the #OppChalls (opportunity
  –Internet-of-Things-Chartchallenges) that lie ahead with the IoT.



  First: yes, the IoT’s potential boggles the mind

  Let me first reiterate that the benefits of ubiquitous connectivity, of
  very-big-and-very- real-time-data, of truly intelligent digital assistants, of
  cognitive computing, deep learning and robotics are obvious to anyone with even
  basic powers of imagination – it would indeed be foolish to not try to harness
  this enormous potential. The central premise of the IoT is simple: when
  everything gets connected, once data is being collected in real-time,
  everywhere, all the time, we can measure, analyse, anticipate or even predict
  events and ‘truths’ that were previously hidden under the surface. We can make
  things and processes so much more efficient, and save trillions of dollars in
  the process; and possibly solve global warming, as well (some experts would
  argue).



  Clearly, a quickly evolving Cloud-OS / neural-network-in-the-cloud  of
  inter-connected devices, sensors, hardware and processes might well kick-off
  a new era of optimization and hyper-efficiency in the energy, food, shipping
  and logistics, media, traffic, building and construction sectors. This could be
  huge.... read on
